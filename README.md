The custom module name is Agiledrop Event Days.
The block is named Days Event and needs to be added to the sidebar through admin UI. 

My drupal installation was in a folder agiledrop (localhost/agiledrop). 
So the file structure was/is:
-agiledrop
  -modules
    -src
      -Controller
      -Days
      -Plugin
        -Block
